                    <P class="body-sm">Dandruff is a condition of the scalp that causes visible scales, consisting of dead skin cells that clump together with the sebum of the skin to form white to yellowish flakes. Sebaceous glands are present in the skin of every human being. These glands produce lipids. When the lipids reach the surface of the skin, they are called sebum (a mixture of fats and proteins).
                    </P>
                    <p class="body-sm">Sebum makes hair and skin smooth, shiny and water repellent. It protects against dehydration. Dandruff can also be found on the scalp of almost every person, because our skin is constantly renewing itself by shedding old, dead skin cells. When it comes into contact with sebum, it becomes visible as skin flakes.</p>

One of these fungi species is Malassezia furfur. The fungus needs fat to grow. Therefore, it likes to live on sebaceous skin and hairy areas of the body:</p>

                    <p class="body-sm">Seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff often occur on the head and face, but it can also affect other parts of the body. It is often seasonal: those affected suffer more during winter than summer. Antifungal agents are recommended for therapy.

                            Initially small, later larger, round to oval spots on the skin. <br>
                            Spots in different shades of red (pink, brown, red, black).<br>
                            Affected areas of the skin are significantly lighter than the surrounding healthy skin or even without pigmentation (pityriasis versicolor alba).<br>
                            The skin is slightly swollen in the affected areas, but itching occurs rather rarely and if so, only slightly.

                    <p class="body-sm">Do not scratch. Otherwise, the skin may shed in small flakes. The bran fungus does not cause dandruff-like seborrheic dermatitis, but it is also caused by the yeast-like fungus Malassezia furfur.
                    </p>
                    <p class="body-sm">What helps? Antifungal agents are particularly successful in acute therapy. However, the spots on the affected areas are often visible for several months after treatment. Treatment should be continued as a precautionary measure, even after healing.</p>

                    <p>Antifungals eliminate the cause of diseases that are originated by fungi. If the scalp is excessively colonized with the yeast-like fungus Malassezia furfur, the active ingredient Ketoconazole 2% has proven to be particularly suitable. It damages the cell membrane of the fungus. Thus, Ketoconazole 2% fights its excessive growth and minimizes the formation of dandruff. The effect lasts for up to two weeks after rinsing.</p>
