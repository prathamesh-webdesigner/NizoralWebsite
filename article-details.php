                <p class="body-sm">

                                    Even if dry scalp is not a serious problem as such, it is important to address it as soon as possible. The moment the skin loses its natural moisture, its protective layer is more prone to damage. Harmful substances and allergens can more easily enter the skin and subsequently cause micro-inflammation of the scalp, manifesting in redness, irritation, and intense itching. In addition, micro-inflammation of the scalp is a common cause of hair conditions such as dandruff and hair loss.

                <p class="body-sm">
                    The basis of hair and scalp care is using the right hair care products and following the right hair washing procedure, which is very often underestimated. When choosing a shampoo, avoid irritating products full of chemical ingredients and reach for shampoos that are specifically designed for the needs of flaky  and itchy scalp . Nizoral Expert Daily Care Shampoo for instance contains novel moisturizers that hydrate the scalp, while further ingredients relieve itching. After using shampoo, you can also apply a moisturizing conditioner or hair mask to your hair.

                            Always wash your hair with lukewarm water. Only wash your hair when you really need to. Washing your hair too often can dry out your scalp even more. On the other hand, if you wash your hair too little, sebum could build up. Too much sebum can inhibit the natural sloughing off of dead skin cells and lead to itchy scalps.
