                <p>
                    Environmental protection is a good thing. If the environment is well, we are fine, too.
                    Unfortunately, there is a downside: In the case of dandruff, which is most commonly caused by a
                    yeast-like fungus called Malassezia furfur, the environment can also be a health risk. Some external
                    environmental factors can contribute to the cause by influencing the production of sebum and
                    promoting excessive growth of the fungus.

                        <h2>AIR <br> POLLUTION</h2>
                        <P>Air pollution can promote dandruff. People in big cities certainly know that. The air is full
                            of
                            exhaust fumes, which does not only make breathing difficult. It is not good for the skin
                            either.
                            The skin gets less Vitamin E. Vitamin E protects the skin.
                        </P>
                        <p>Air pollution can also irritate the scalp. Possible consequence: Itching and inflammation of
                            the
                            scalp and dandruff. However, we are not only exposed to air pollution outside. Scientists
                            have
                            found harmful gases, such as formaldehyde, in many indoor areas. For example, scientific
                            studies
                            reveal that the level of formaldehyde in the air may rise, if there is a lot of smoking. The
                            active ingredient Ketoconazole 2% in Nizoral® reduces annoying redness and relieves itching
                            of
                            the scalp.</p>

                        <P>In winter we like to stay cozy and warm. Before we go outside, we first get dressed – layer
                            after layer. Of course, hat and scarf should not be missing. However, such an outfit has a
                            downside: While it prevents us from freezing, the temperature on the scalp rises. The
                            resulting sweat creates the perfect breeding ground for Malassezia furfur, the yeast-like
                            fungus that causes dandruff.
